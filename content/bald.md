Okay, don't get me wrong, there are definite advantages to being bald. You don't have to mess around with hair products, you never have a bad hair day, and being shiny is quite nice. That being said, when it rains, you have no hair to absorb the water so the rain just streams into your face. That sucks. Also, in the summer you always have to put suntan lotion on your head (a peeling head is gross). Last, unless you are into comb overs there's the shaving - it's like you have twice the amount of face to deal with. Weighing it all up, and considering that if you have hair you can always shave it, I would have to say that being bald is at least 50% suck-o-meter worthy.
