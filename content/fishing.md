Ok... first... worms.. enough said. Second, if you catch anything you have to deal with a slimy stinky fish that will make your hands smell for days. Last, I don't know what it is about fishing off of a dock, but there always seems to be an old person lurking that wants to come over to ask if you've caught anything which of course turns into what feels like an eternity of painful conversation. Thumbs down to fishing off of a dock.
