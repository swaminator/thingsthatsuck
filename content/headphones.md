I think I got suckered by one of those fake review sites that are put up by people trying to make money through affiliate programs. The wired connection stopped working after a few months, and then the headband snapped. Truthfully, I was kinda glad when they died because the strap had no padding and bothered my bald head. My Bose headphones are much better (and they have padding on the strap YAY!!!!!).
