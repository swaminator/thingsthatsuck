Rates very high on the suck-o-meter. First, getting the eggs to not be gross is near to impossible, and even worse, the stupid thing exploded in the microwave on the 3rd attempt to make eggs. End result, an egg disaster all over the microwave that took an hour to clean. You can make a lot of eggs in an hour which would have been a lot easier than trying to make eggs with this awful device.
